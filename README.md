# üöÄ CodeShare - Chromium Extension üöÄ

> This Chrome extension is based on the code from a Firefox extension originally developed by Prasath K available at [github.com/Pr454th/CodeShare](https://github.com/Pr454th/CodeShare). I have modified the code to make it work for chromium based browsers and have added some new features as well.


The CodeShare Extension for chromium based browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave and others allows users to quickly and easily share code snippets or text with others. This extension simplifies the sharing process, reducing the number of steps involved.
